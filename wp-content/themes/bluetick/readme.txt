## Developing With npm, Gulp and SASS and [Browser Sync][1]

### Installing Dependencies
- Make sure you have installed Node.js and Browser-Sync* (* optional, if you wanna use it) on your computer globally
- Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your UnderStrap copy
- Run: `$ npm install` and then: `$ gulp copy-assets`

### Running
To work and compile your Sass files on the fly start:

- `$ gulp watch`

Or, to run with Browser-Sync:

- First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in the file `/gulpfile.js` in the beginning of the file:
```javascript
var browserSyncOptions = {
    proxy: "localhost/theme_test/", // <----- CHANGE HERE
    notify: false
};
```
- then run: `$ gulp watch-bs`
